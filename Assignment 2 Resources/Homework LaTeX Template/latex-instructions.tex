\maketitle

In this class, when you are asked to typeset homework you may do
so in \LaTeX.  Some of the macros come from standard packages, 
and some from local definitions.  As the sources of this file 
show, all the supplied packages and macro definitions can be 
loaded by means of the \LaTeX command 
\verb+\input{5963_6360-macros.tex}+. That file then loads others.

You are \textbf{\textit{strongly}} encouraged to typeset your answers for 
readability, but you need not typeset your answers in \LaTeX. 
All answer submissions should include a PDF version of the 
answers. You are encouraged to prepare your answers by simply 
adding them into a copy of the homework source.  If you decide
to do so, be sure to replace the name in the author environment:

\begin{verbatim}
\author{Rogelio E. Cardona-Rivera}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Further, use the constructs \verb+\begin{answer}+ and 
\verb+\end{answer}+ to begin and end your answer.  For example, 
the code,

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{answer}
I think, therefore I am.
\end{answer}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent produces the result:\\[5pt]

\begin{answer}
I think, therefore I am.
\end{answer}
